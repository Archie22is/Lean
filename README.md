### A WordPress Theme Using _s, Bourbon + Neat and Theme Hook Alliance
=======

I got bored on a Saturday and set out to build a super basic WordPress theme. Not enough damn peyote and more than enough time makes for a potent mix of futility... I need a girlfriend. Send help!

**Okay, so, right now here's where we're at:**

* Underscores (_s) based theme. There's smarter folks than me building great shit (http://underscores.me)
* Sass. We're using it and to update this theme you should be cozy with it or get ready to learn how to use. As of the initial writing of this ReadMe, I've been using Sass like a piece of shit asshole. I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. So if you do, please feel free to school a chump! If you don't know Sass, you should definitely jump in. The water's fine and you'll thank me later. I accept thanks in burritos, doritos, fritos and cheetos only.
* Responsive â€” Eh. I mean, it's about as minimal as you can get, but it's there.
* Merge requests welcome...



Coming Soon
---------------

* Theme Hook Alliance Integration. Yeah, I'm lazy. That's next on my to-do list! You guys sound like my mother! 
* Further use of WP Customizer. I don't know how to use the fucking thing, so tips are appreciated; so don't be a lazy fucker!

Getting Started
---------------

I'll be coming back to this later
